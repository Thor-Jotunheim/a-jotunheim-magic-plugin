1.	Respect & Conduct
○	Treat all players with respect, both in-game and on Discord. Aggressive, harassing, or offensive behavior—including griefing or stealing, hate speech, or vulgar content—will not be tolerated.
○	Do not interfere with another player’s gameplay, including joining boss fights without prior agreement.
○	Do not engage in PvP unless all parties agree.
○	If you experience uncomfortable situations, contact staff via ⁠#support-tickets.
○	Follow staff instructions and decisions. Being combative or rude to staff may result in a ban.
○	You agree that staff may change your Discord nickname on the server to match your Viking name upon whitelisting, allowing connection only with that character.
○	Stay up to date with server announcements and rules.

2.	Fair Play
○	No cheating, exploiting, having multiple characters, or using third-party tools/mods for unfair advantage.
○	Do not use or share the map seed; report it if discovered.
○	No clipping into caves/dungeons/crypts/rocks/trees etc.
○	Do not take or use items, animals, crops, loot, or builds that aren’t yours without permission whether in a base or in the wild.
i.	i.e. If you find 20 silver ore on the ground when exploring, you cannot take it and must leave it alone.
○	Only use boats you built, the one free Karve you get from spawn, or a boat you have permission to use.
○	Report wandering tamed animals via #support-tickets.

3.	Groups & Team Play
○	Communicate with others before starting major builds, events, or activities that could impact the community.
○	You are welcome to team up and share resources, bases, and progress with others. Jotunheim group features and benefits are available after creating a Group Manager.
○	When helping new players or group members, consider supporting their natural progression rather than providing high-level gear or resources immediately, however it is not against the rules(see next point on progression). 
○	Progression:
i.	Play how you want as long as all other rules are followed. You are responsible for your own progression. If you visit another’s player base and unlock recipes you didn’t want to, or read their cartography table that is on you. 
ii.	However, if you want to reset your map press F5 to open the console and type “resetsharedmap”. All of the marks and shared map exploration received from a cartography table will be erased from your personal map. 
iii.	If you want to buy gear or speed-run through bosses, or join an end game group you’re free to do so. 
○	Trading:
i.	There are no trade restrictions for normally occurring/built in-game items.  However, if you would like an idea of what items should cost. Please refer to the Server Pricelist for more info.

4.	Resources
○	Do not build on or block access to crucial resources (dungeons, crypts, caves, ores, villages, and etc.).Most resources reset automatically at random intervals and will destroy anything you may have built on them. Be warned, there will be no reimbursement
i.	Exceptions: Yggdrasil Roots and Spawners (Skeleton, Draugr, Greydwarf, and Surtling) are OK to build on. 
ii.	Silver is particularly hard to spot. If you build in the mountains make sure you check with a wishbone you are not building on a Silver Vein. 
○	It is discouraged to build inside large stones or boulders since they may be accidentally reset by admins. If you do, please make sure that the build is still clearly visible from the outside.
○	Special Note: Any builds that are found to be blocking access to the resources mentioned above, even if partially, may be removed by staff without prior warning or compensation.

5.	Building
○	Staff may modify or remove builds that break rules or belong to inactive players without reimbursement.
○	Do not modify, overtake, or destroy another player’s base or community infrastructure, including admin-built roads and bridges.
i.	Special Note: There is one exception to the above. If a bridge is blocking a waterway for boats, you may make the bridge taller without permission from its owner, followed by a ticket in #support-tickets to let the staff know about it. 
○	You may not do anything to any abandoned base without first getting permission via a support ticket. If you believe a base is abandoned, submit a #support-tickets with a screenshot and coordinates (done by pressing F5 and typing pos) for staff review.
○	Staff/Restricted Areas: Areas marked with GIANT ‘X’ building pieces are reserved for admin or events—do not enter, build, or use ‘X’ pieces to mark your own territory. (See FAQ for example)

○	Do not leave objects like carts, boats, portals or signs where they block paths, resources, or scenic views.
○	Sign Etiquette: Signs must be tasteful, fit the Viking theme, not mark territory, and not block scenic views or resources. 
i.	Floating text that is significantly offset from a structure is not allowed.
○	Ashlands: 
i.	Building permanent structures in the Ashlands mainland is prohibited.You may only build along the coastline, up to 12m inland from the waterline—excluding a temporary pocket portal in active use.
ii.	This base must not block or ward any of the Ashlands resource nodes or paths to those resources. Ashlands resources will also respawn randomly which will reset any builds nearby in the same way resources respawn in the Mistlands (you have been warned, there will be no compensation for lost materials). A portal hut counts as a base in the Ashlands.
iii.	Special Note: Failure to comply with any of these Ashland rules could result in a ban. Builds of any kind that violate the above rules will be removed without warning or compensation.
○	Public Structures: If you want to create a public structure, it has to be marked clearly with a sign and it should be obvious where it starts and ends. Make sure visitors can tell what is free to use or take and what is private.


Breaking any of these rules can lead to a permanent ban.
