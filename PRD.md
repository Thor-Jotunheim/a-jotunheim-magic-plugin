# Jotunheim Shop Manager - Product Requirements Document

Create a comprehensive shop management system for the Jotunheim gaming community to replace Google Sheets-based transaction tracking, player registration, and inventory management with Discord OAuth authentication.

**Experience Qualities**: 
1. **Efficient** - Streamlined workflows that reduce administrative overhead compared to complex spreadsheet operations
2. **Reliable** - Persistent data storage with clear transaction validation and error handling
3. **Secure** - Discord-based authentication with role-based access control through jotun.games backend integration

**Complexity Level**: 
- Complex Application (advanced functionality, accounts, authentication)
- This system handles multiple interconnected data types (players, transactions, items, ledgers) with role-based access, Discord OAuth integration, and complex business logic for legacy item management and world resets.

- **Concurrent Access**: Handle multiple users editing same data with conflict resolution
- **Data Corruption Recovery**: Backup mechanisms and data validation checks

## Design Direction

The design should feel professional and reliable like enterprise software, emphasizing data integrity and operational efficiency over visual flair, with a clean minimal interface that prioritizes functionality and reduces cognitive load during high-frequency administrative tasks.

## Color Selection

Triadic color scheme using blue, amber, and green to represent different operational states and shop types while maintaining professional appearance.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 240)) - Communicates trust and stability for core actions
- **Secondary Colors**: Slate Gray (oklch(0.35 0.02 240)) for backgrounds and Steel Blue (oklch(0.55 0.12 240)) for secondary actions
- **Accent Color**: Amber (oklch(0.75 0.15 60)) - Attention-grabbing highlight for important actions and warnings
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (White oklch(0.98 0.01 240)): Dark Blue text (oklch(0.25 0.05 240)) - Ratio 8.2:1 âœ“
  - Primary (Deep Blue oklch(0.45 0.15 240)): White text (oklch(0.98 0.01 240)) - Ratio 6.8:1 âœ“
  - Secondary (Slate Gray oklch(0.35 0.02 240)): White text (oklch(0.98 0.01 240)) - Ratio 9.1:1 âœ“
  - Accent (Amber oklch(0.75 0.15 60)): Dark Blue text (oklch(0.25 0.05 240)) - Ratio 7.4:1 âœ“

## Font Selection

Clean, readable sans-serif typography that conveys professionalism and ensures excellent legibility during data entry tasks, using Inter for its exceptional clarity at all sizes.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - H1 (Page Titles): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter SemiBold/24px/normal spacing  
  - H3 (Subsections): Inter Medium/18px/normal spacing
  - Body Text: Inter Regular/16px/relaxed spacing
  - Small Text: Inter Regular/14px/normal spacing

## Animations

Subtle and functional animations that provide immediate feedback without interfering with rapid data entry workflows, focusing on state transitions and form validation.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Quick micro-interactions communicate system responsiveness and guide attention to important state changes
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Form validation gets immediate animation priority, followed by navigation transitions, with decorative elements minimized

## Component Selection

- **Components**: 
  - Forms: Input, Select, Button components with validation states
  - Data Display: Table, Card for transaction lists and player information
  - Navigation: Tabs for different shop types and functions
  - Dialogs: AlertDialog for confirmations, Dialog for complex forms
